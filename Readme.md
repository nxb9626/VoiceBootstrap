# VoiceBootstrap

Opens the Minecraft launcher in a way that the [Simple Voice Chat](https://github.com/henkelmax/simple-voice-chat) can access the MacOS microphone api.

## Why?

The executable `.app` shell script can moved into the Applications directory, making it easier to launch than manually opening a terminal.

## How to use?

Clone the repo or download the `VoiceBootstrap.app` file, and put it in the Applications directory.

Optional steps:
 - Rename it to something you like more!
 - Drag it to your dock!
